          <h2>Espresso Lounge at Jeju-do</h2>
          <p>After enjoying some Jeju black pork at Neulbom Heukdwaeji, 
            we have just one more attraction to hit before driving to the East side 
            of the island. It's an attraction welcomed by most coffee lovers but not 
            someone like my little nugget.Located in the heart of Jeju's downtown area 
            just across the street from Neulbom (where we had lunch), 
            Espresso Lounge is a pilgrimage well worth the time and effort whether you love coffee or not.
            The two-story premise combines a coffee shop and bakery cafe both under one roof.
            I love a coffee shop with an abundance of natural daylight. 
            Just by looking at the facility, you knew they're very serious about their coffee. </p>

              <p>YES! Next door, they have their in-house bakery kitchen. 
                I could smell some freshly baked croissants coming out of the oven soon!
                They have got their own coffee roaster here.</p>

                <p>I had my eyes on their almond croissant all the way. 
                  There were 2 still sitting there when I was taking my photos but 
                  by the time I finished my photo-taking, they were long gone. </p>

                <p>I decided to get some afternoon snacks for everyone. 
                  Sausage roll (for little guy), scone (for Jelloman) and some milk buns (for myself). 
                  No almond croissant (weep...). 
                  Some espresso, latte and a separate list of hand-drip coffee too...</p>

              <p>It was pretty hot this afternoon (despite some showers) so we were getting a 
                pair of iced latte to cool things off - Iced caramel latte and Valrhona chocolate 
                latte (6,000 won each). Pecan pie (4,000 won) - It's so hard to find a place serving 
                authentic American pecan pie in Hong Kong and Seoul. 
                Hack, it's hard to find one in all of Asia so I was over the moon 
                when I saw this in the display counter.</p>
